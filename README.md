# HADigital

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.


## Project Overview: HADigital
HADigital is a full-stack web application showcasing your expertise in both front-end and back-end development using modern web technologies.

Front-End:
The front-end is built with Angular, a robust framework for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs). Key features include:

Component-Based Architecture: Reusable and modular components.
Routing: Angular Router is used for navigation between different views.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is accessible across various devices.
Angular Material: For UI components, enhancing the application's aesthetics and usability.
State Management: Managed through services, ensuring consistent data flow across the app.
Key Technologies:

Angular
TypeScript
HTML5
SCSS (CSS preprocessor)
Angular Material
RxJS (for reactive programming)
Back-End:
The back-end is developed using Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API that interacts with a MongoDB database. It handles all the server-side logic, including:

CRUD Operations: Manages Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for various resources.
Authentication: Implements user authentication (likely using JWT) to secure routes and manage user sessions.
Database Integration: Uses Mongoose to interface with MongoDB, defining schemas and models for data validation and storage.
Middleware: Handles authentication, logging, and error management, ensuring robust and secure API interactions.
Environment Configuration: Manages different environments (development, production) using configuration files.
Key Technologies:

Node.js
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose (for MongoDB interactions)
JWT (for authentication)
Body-parser and CORS (middleware)
Mocha/Chai for testing
Summary:
This project demonstrates your ability to develop full-stack applications using Angular for the front-end and Node.js/Express for the back-end. It highlights your skills in creating a modular, maintainable, and scalable application, with a focus on user interface design, data management, and security.
